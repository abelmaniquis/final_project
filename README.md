Welcome to your Node.js project on Cloud9 IDE!

This chat example showcases how to use socket.io with a static express server.

Running the server

Open server.js and start the app by clicking on the “Run” button in the top menu.

Alternatively you can launch the app from the Terminal:

$ node server.js

Once the server is running, open the project in the shape of 'https://projectname-username.c9.io/’. 
As you enter your name, watch the Users list (on the left) update. Once you press Enter or Send, the 
message is shared with all connected clients.
